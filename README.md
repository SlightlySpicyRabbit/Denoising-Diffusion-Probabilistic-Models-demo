# Denoising-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Models-demo

## Overview
It is a demo about Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, includes the following content:
* Explain in detail the reasoning and training process of the basic diffusion model
* The mathematical principles of forward and reverse diffusion. And a mathematical proof of the simplification technique in reverse diffusion
* Some visualizations to aid understanding
* Briefly describe the advantages and limitations of diffusion models

## Runtime Environment
* This tutorial is written on Python 3.9.13
* Three external libraries are used: torch, sklearn, matplotlib

## Note
* This tutorial is intended for readers who have a basic understanding of mathematics and deep neural networks.
* While this is a novel implementation, it cannot be ignored that it was inspired by many existing tutorials or blog posts.
